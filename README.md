# Gradient_Based-Optimizatio-in-Python
This repository contains the implementation of a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO). Inspired by the gradient-based Newtonâ€™s method, GBO is designed for both mathematical optimization and real-world problem-solving with enhanced exploration and exploitation capabilities.
